This project presents an enhanced version of a customer sales analysis, aimed at uncovering deeper insights into product performance and customer behavior. Using Python for data exploration and visualization, along with SQL for structured queries, the analysis focuses on optimizing sales strategies through clearer data representation and smarter segmentation.

Key improvements include robust data cleaning processes, such as outlier detection using boxplots and standardization of date formats for consistency. A new “Season” feature was engineered to analyze sales trends across different times of the year, allowing for seasonal pattern discovery and trend forecasting.

The analysis highlights top-selling products, calculates average order values per customer, and applies RFM segmentation to categorize customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. This segmentation enhances understanding of customer value and loyalty patterns.

To support interpretation, the project features a range of visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, including bar charts, line plots, area graphs, heatmaps, and distribution plots. These visuals aid in quickly spotting trends, anomalies, and key performance indicators.

Overall, this improved analysis transforms raw sales data into strategic insights, offering a practical tool for business intelligence and decision-making in a sales-driven environment.
